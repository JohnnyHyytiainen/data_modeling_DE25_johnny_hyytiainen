# Class noted for week 5 Data Modeling course.
## Topics are:

```text

- Structured data: Relational data -> Relational/SQL DB

- Semi-structured data: documents, key-value pairs(json/jsonl for example), graphs, column-families(see CFDB)
    - Column Family Database (CFDB) is a type of NoSQL database that organizes data by column families instead of rows.

- Non-structured data: Object storage(.png, .mp4, .mp3 (image, video, sound files are an example of non structured data))

Usage for Semi / non(un) - structured data

Main uses for semi and non-structured data is mostly for speed.  

* What matters when using semi-structured data (speaking of key:value pairs) is not the data type in the key or the value. What matters are the KEY and the VALUE pair. 

  * Example: key:value pair with a str:list {"string_as_key":["a", "list", "with", "strings", "and", "different", 1, "values", "within", "the", "list"]} 

  * Example: key:value pair with a string and an int as key:value {"A string":1992}
