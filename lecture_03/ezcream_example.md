# Conceptual models

## Ezecream example from lecture note

**conceptual ERD**
- The key difference between a conceptual model vs logical model is that:
    - The conceptual model only contains the entities and relationships.
    - One to one, one or many to zero or many, many to many etc etc.

- The conceptual model models the "real world" in broad strokes. It reflects the real world in general terms.
  - The difference between a conceptual model and a logical model is that the logical model is more specialized. I.e it shows the attributes, the relationships etc. It shows the general picture but more in depth and specialized compared to the conceptual model.


**Relationship statements**
- A customer places *ONE or MANY* Orders
- An order is placed by *ONE and only ONE* customer
- An Order contains *ONE or MANY* Products
- A Product is contained in *ZERO or many ORDERS*
