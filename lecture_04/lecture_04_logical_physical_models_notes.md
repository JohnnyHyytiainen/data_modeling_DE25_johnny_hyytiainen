# Logical and physical models.

**logical data model(LDM)**
- The key difference between a logical model vs conceptual model is that:
    - The conceptual model only contains the entities and relationships.
    - The conceptual model models the "real world" in broad strokes. It reflects the real world in general terms.

- The **difference** between a **logical model** and the conceptual model is that **the logical model is more specialized**. A logical model also contains the attributes for the entitys.
    - It shows the general picture as the conceptual model shows BUT more in depth and specialized.

- In the logical model you have SPECIFIED which attributes the entities SHOULD have.


**physical data model(PDM)** 
- The key difference between the physical model vs logical model is that:
    - The physical model contains more specified information vs the logical model.
    - The physical model contains primary keys(PK), foreign keys(FK), data types(domain constraints)

- domain is defined in physical data models. Example:
    - Primary key(PK)
    - Foreign key(FK)
    - Varchar(50), varchar(100), varchar(255), INTEGER, Bigint etc etc.
